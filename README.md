# Brian Voo – Computer Science ePortfolio

This ePortfolio documents my academic and technical journey throughout the Computer Science program and serves as the culminating deliverable for the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone. The portfolio brings together a collection of carefully selected artifacts that demonstrate my growth, skills, and readiness to transition into a professional computing environment. By presenting both original and enhanced versions of my work, this portfolio highlights my ability to reflect on prior implementations, apply feedback, and improve solutions using industry-aligned best practices.

The artifacts included in this ePortfolio represent key areas of computer science, including software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, databases, and secure application development. Several artifacts intentionally demonstrate competencies across multiple categories, reflecting the interconnected nature of real-world software systems. Each artifact has been enhanced beyond its original course requirements to improve functionality, efficiency, maintainability, and security, while addressing limitations or inconsistencies identified during review.

Overall, this ePortfolio illustrates my problem-solving approach, attention to detail, and commitment to producing high-quality, well-documented software solutions. It conveys my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly, apply foundational and advanced computing principles, and adapt my skills to meet evolving requirements. Collectively, these works demonstrate my readiness for a career in software engineering and my motivation to continue developing as a computer science professional.
