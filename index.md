# Brian Voo – Computer Science ePortfolio

# Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout the Computer Science program and the CS 499 Capstone, I have developed the technical expertise, professional discipline, and security-focused mindset necessary to succeed in a modern computing environment. This ePortfolio represents the culmination of my academic journey and demonstrates my ability to design, evaluate, and enhance software solutions that are secure, efficient, and professionally structured. By revisiting earlier work and applying targeted enhancements, I was able to reflect on my growth and showcase measurable improvement across the program learning outcomes.

A primary outcome demonstrated in this portfolio is my ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality software solutions. Enhancing my CS-360 Android inventory application required redesigning authentication with password hashing, implementing role-based access control, strengthening input validation, and improving session handling and UI flow. These enhancements reflect industry-aligned software engineering practices and demonstrate my ability to identify weaknesses in existing systems and apply secure, maintainable design solutions.

This portfolio also demonstrates my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using appropriate algorithms and data structures. By enhancing my CS-300 Course Planner program with a Binary Search Tree alongside a hash table, I explored trade-offs related to time complexity, memory usage, and system organization. Implementing recursive traversal, managing dynamic memory, and maintaining parallel data structures strengthened my ability to reason algorithmically and justify design decisions based on efficiency and scalability.

My work further reflects the outcome of using well-founded and innovative computing techniques, skills, and tools. Through backend development and database enhancements, I transformed a MongoDB CRUD module into a secure and extensible data-access layer by adding authentication, hashed and salted passwords, audit logging, input validation, and aggregation pipelines. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to apply modern tools and technologies to create reliable, data-driven systems suitable for real-world applications.

Across all artifacts, I demonstrate a consistent security mindset, anticipating potential vulnerabilities and incorporating safeguards into the design process. Protecting sensitive data, enforcing access controls, validating input, and maintaining accountability through logging were integrated as foundational design principles rather than afterthoughts. This approach reflects both ethical responsibility and professional readiness in software development.

Finally, this portfolio highlights my ability to communicate effectively and collaborate within professional environments. Through structured narratives, documentation, and a code review video, I clearly explain technical decisions and design trade-offs to diverse audiences. Collectively, these artifacts reflect my progression from a student focused on functionality to a computer science professional who prioritizes security, quality, and clarity. I am confident that the skills and experience demonstrated in this ePortfolio prepare me to contribute effectively in a professional software engineering role and continue growing within the field of computer science.

# Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

**Introduction:**

The artifact I selected for Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures is my CS-300 Course Planner program, a C++ application designed to manage and display course information loaded from a CSV file. The original version of this program stored all course data using a single unordered_map, which allowed for fast lookups but did not fully demonstrate deeper algorithmic reasoning or the use of more complex data structures. While the program functioned correctly, it presented an opportunity to enhance both the structure and the computational approach used to manage and retrieve data.

This artifact was originally developed during my CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms course as part of the Computer Science program at SNHU. I selected this project for enhancement because it provided a strong foundation for demonstrating algorithm selection, data structure evaluation, and performance trade-offs. Data organization and retrieval are core components of computer science, and enhancing this program allowed me to showcase my ability to apply algorithmic principles in a practical and meaningful way.

To enhance this artifact, I implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) alongside the existing hash table and restructured the program logic to support both data structures. This enhancement introduced recursive insertion, searching, and in-order traversal, allowing the program to display courses in sorted order without relying on an additional sorting algorithm. These changes strengthened the algorithmic depth of the program and demonstrated my ability to evaluate and apply appropriate data structures based on problem requirements and efficiency considerations.

**Conclusion:**

Through the enhancement of this artifact, I demonstrated my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and data structures while managing trade-offs related to performance, memory usage, and system complexity. By implementing a Binary Search Tree alongside a hash table, I balanced fast lookup performance with structured, ordered data traversal. This approach allowed the program to efficiently retrieve data while also producing sorted output through in-order traversal, eliminating the need for additional sorting logic.

This artifact also demonstrates my ability to apply well-founded computing techniques and write clean, maintainable C++ code. Implementing recursive algorithms, managing node relationships, and ensuring proper memory cleanup required careful attention to detail and reinforced the importance of responsible resource management when working with dynamic data structures. Documenting time complexity and refactoring the program logic improved readability and made the algorithmic decisions more transparent to future developers.

Throughout the enhancement process, I gained a deeper understanding of how different data structures impact efficiency and scalability. One of the key challenges was ensuring consistency between the hash table and the BST while avoiding duplicate nodes or memory issues. By restructuring insertion logic and adding cleanup routines, I resolved these challenges and improved the overall stability of the program.

Enhancing this artifact strengthened my confidence in applying algorithms and data structures to real-world problems. It reinforced my ability to analyze existing solutions, justify design decisions, and implement improvements that align with computer science best practices. Overall, this artifact reflects my growth in algorithmic thinking and my readiness to design efficient, well-structured solutions in a professional computing environment.


# Artifact Three: Databases

**Introduction:**

The artifact selected for Enhancement Three: Databases is my CS-340 MongoDB CRUD module developed in Python for the Grazioso Salvare project. This module serves as a data-access layer that connects to a MongoDB database and performs create, read, update, and delete operations on an animal records collection. The original version of the module focused primarily on functional database interaction and basic CRUD capabilities, but it lacked security controls, input validation, and advanced database features commonly expected in professional backend systems.

This artifact was originally developed during the CS-340 Client/Server Development course as part of the Computer Science program at SNHU. I selected this project for enhancement because database systems are central to modern software applications, and improving this module provided an opportunity to demonstrate secure database design, backend development, and data management best practices. Enhancing this artifact allowed me to move beyond basic data manipulation and apply industry-aligned techniques for protecting data, ensuring integrity, and supporting analytical functionality.

To enhance this artifact, I redesigned the module to include application-level authentication with hashed and salted passwords, input validation to reduce injection risks, audit logging for all CRUD operations, and MongoDB aggregation pipelines to support analytical queries. These enhancements transformed the module from a simple CRUD interface into a more secure, robust, and professional data-access layer suitable for real-world software systems.
